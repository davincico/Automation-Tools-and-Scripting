# Automation-Tools-and-Scripting
Automation tools and scripts for Security operations, file analysis, running basic commands. 

## Introduction
Starting this repo as a collection of some of the automation tools I am working on or modified. My intention is to build tools to streamline work processes for Security Operations Center (SOC), i.e. Automate File Analysis
Some of these scripts are mine, some of them are not. I will try to make sure credit for others work is given where due, though sometimes I no longer know who the original author actually is. If you happen to see code you recognize here please let me know in a Issue so I can assign proper credit.
